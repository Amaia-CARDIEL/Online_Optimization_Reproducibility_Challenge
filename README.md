# Online Optimization - Reproducibility Challenge

This repository contains the work done as I participated in my Online Optimization graduate course's Reproducibility Challenge, covering papers chosen by our academic supervisor, Professor Olivier Wintenberger (Sorbonne Universit√©).

This project involved the implementation of the Online Optimization algorithm named **Streaming sparse regression** (SSR), following the paper: [Jacob Steinhardt, Stefan Wager, Percy Liang, The Statistics of Streaming Sparse Regression, arXiv, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4182).

We compared found results with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and projected Stochastic Gradient Descent, our chosen baselines.
